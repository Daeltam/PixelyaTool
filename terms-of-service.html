    <h1>Terms of service</h1>
    <p>
        This bot has been made by @Daeltam, the entire code belongs to him.
        <br>
        The repository is under the AGPL-3.0 license. This means please don't use my code for commercial use, and please warn me if you're using a part of it for your own bot, i'd be happy to see it's useful to anyone.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>This bot does not require a lot of rules, but here they are :</p>
    <ul style="display: inline-block;text-align: left;">
        <li>Do not Spam the commands, especially the download commands. They require time to process, and the server can have a hard time handling the files.</li>
        <li>If a command didn't work, wait for several minutes before tring again, and make sure the error does not come from your part.</li>
        <li>The bot can sometimes crash if the file was too heavy and the limit we set was too high. Please join the discord or dm me on discord to warn me.</li>
    </ul>
