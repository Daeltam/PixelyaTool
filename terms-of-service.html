        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>This bot has been made by <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/1094995425326542898" target="_blank">@Daeltam</a>, the entire code belongs to him.</p>

            The repository is under the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/">AGPL-3.0 license</a>.<br>
            This means you are allowed to use it in your projects at the condition that your project is Open Source and you keep the same license (AGPL-3.0)
        </p>
        <p>
            This being said, please don't use my code for commercial use.<br>
            Also, please warn me if you're using a part of it for your own bot, I'd be happy to see it being useful to anyone.

        <hr> <!-- RULES -->
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>This bot does not require a lot of rules, but here they are :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not ruin this for others, for example by rendering the bot unusable.</li>
            <li>Do not spam the commands, especially the download commands. 
                They require time to process, and the server can have a hard time handling the files.
            </li>
            <li>If a command didn't work, wait for several minutes before trying again, and make sure the error does not come from your part.</li>
            <li>The bot can sometimes crash if the file was too heavy for the server or Discord to handle.
                In this case it should automatically restart.
                Do not try using the same command again, it will result in the same issue.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <!-- TERMS REFUSAL -->
        <h2>When you do not respect these terms...</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We reserve the right to terminate your access to the service at any time if we feel it is necessary.</li>
